9. **Scope and Hoisting**  
   Understand variable scope inside and outside functions.  
   Recognize and explain function and variable hoisting.

10. **Type Conversion**  
    Convert between different data types (string to number, number to string).

11. **Error Handling**  
    Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions.  
    Throw custom errors with throw statements.

12. **DOM Manipulation**  
    Select and manipulate DOM elements using vanilla JavaScript.  
    Handle events (click, mouseover, keypress) on DOM elements.

13. **Asynchronous JavaScript**  
    Use callbacks to handle asynchronous operations.  
    Fetch data from an API using fetch() and handle responses.

14. **LocalStorage**  
    Store and retrieve data from the browser's localStorage.  
    Use localStorage to persist user settings or data.

15. **Regular Expressions**  
    Create regular expressions to match patterns in strings.  
    Use RegExp methods like test() and exec().

2. **Array Iteration**  
   Write a function to iterate through an array and perform an operation on each element.

3. **Array Methods**  
   Use array methods such as map(), filter(), reduce(), and forEach().
